A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.\n\n***Column Detail***\n---\n\n* *Features*\n  * **Booking_ID** $:$ *unique identifier of each booking*\n  * **no_of_adults** $:$ *Number of adults*\n  * **no_of_children** $:$ *Number of Children*\n  * **no_of_weekend_nights** $:$ *Number of **weekend nights (Saturday or Sunday)** the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel*\n  * **no_of_week_nights** $:$ *Number of **week nights (Monday to Friday)** the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel*\n  * **type_of_meal_plan** $:$ *Type of meal plan booked by the customer:*\n    * *Mean Plan 1*\n    * *Mean Plan 2*\n    * *Mean Plan 3*\n    * *Not Selected*\n  * **required_car_parking_space** $:$ *Does the customer require a car parking space?*\n    * *0 : No*\n    * *1 : Yes*\n  * **room_type_reserved** $:$ *Type of room reserved by the customer.
